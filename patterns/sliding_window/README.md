# Sliding Window Technique
The sliding window technique is a powerful method used in computer science to solve a variety of problems involving arrays or lists. It's particularly useful for problems that require examining contiguous subarrays or substrings. This technique helps reduce the time complexity by avoiding redundant computations.

# When to Use
The sliding window technique is ideal for problems where you need to find or calculate something about all contiguous subarrays of a certain size or with certain properties. Common use cases include:

- Finding the maximum or minimum sum of a subarray of a fixed size.
- Finding the smallest subarray with a sum greater than or equal to a given value.
- Checking for the existence of a permutation of a string within another string.

# How It Works
The basic idea is to have a "window" that slides over the array or string. This window can expand or contract depending on the problem's requirements. Here’s a step-by-step explanation:

1. Initialize the Window:

    - Start with two pointers (usually called left and right) representing the boundaries of the window.
    - Initialize these pointers to the beginning of the array or string.

2. Expand the Window:

    - Move the right pointer to include more elements into the window.
    - Update any relevant variables (e.g., current sum, character count) as you include new elements.

3. Shrink the Window:

    - Once the window meets a specific condition (e.g., the sum of elements within the window exceeds a given value), move the left pointer to exclude elements from the window.
    - Continue updating relevant variables as you exclude elements.

4. Maintain the Optimal Result:

    - During each iteration, check if the current window meets the problem's requirements.
    - Update your result accordingly (e.g., record the smallest window size that meets the condition).

# Example: Minimum Size Subarray Sum

Let's consider the problem: Find the minimal length of a contiguous subarray of which the sum ≥ a given number target.

```python
def minSubArrayLen(self, target: int, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    left, current_sum = 0, 0
    min_length = float('inf')
        
    for right in range(len(nums)):
        current_sum += nums[right]

        while current_sum >= target:
            min_length = min(min_length,right - left + 1)
            current_sum -= nums[left]
            left += 1

    return 0 if min_length == float('inf')else min_length

```

# Explanation:

- Initialize: left is set to the start of the array. total is used to store the sum of the current window, and min_length keeps track of the smallest window found.
- Expand: Iterate through the array using the right pointer. Add each element to total.
- Shrink: When total is greater than or equal to s, update min_length and then reduce the window size by moving the left pointer to the right and subtracting the excluded element from total.
- Result: The smallest length of the window that meets or exceeds the sum s is returned. If no such window exists, return 0.

# Advantages
- Efficiency: Reduces the time complexity from O(n²) to O(n) for many problems.
- Simplicity: Provides a structured way to handle problems involving contiguous subarrays or substrings.

The sliding window technique is a versatile tool in your algorithm toolkit, particularly for handling problems involving sequences of elements where contiguous segments need to be evaluated efficiently.
